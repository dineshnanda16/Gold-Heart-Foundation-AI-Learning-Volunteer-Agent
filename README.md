## PART A: CORE CONCEPT & VALUE (15 points)

### Central Idea

Build a **WhatsApp-based AI multi-agent system** that empowers college students (engineering, medicine, arts) with personalized academic and career support, while simultaneously enabling volunteers at Gold Heart Foundation (GHF) to coordinate events, manage availability, and track impactâ€”creating a scalable, community-driven learning platform that leverages AI agents to amplify human mentorship.

### Track Alignment: Agents for Good

**Why this matters for education:**
- Gold Heart Foundation supports 500+ underprivileged college students annually across STEM, medicine, and humanities disciplines.
- Students face **critical access barriers**: mentors are few, response times are long, and personalized guidance is rare.
- Volunteers struggle with **operational overhead**: manual scheduling, attendance tracking, and communication across WhatsApp groups.
- This creates a **bottleneck**: GHF cannot scale impact without proportional increases in volunteer time and coordinator effort.

**AI agents as the solution:**
The use of AI agents is **clear, meaningful, and central** because:

1. **Multi-agent orchestration** (not a simple chatbot)
   - Router Agent: Classifies incoming messages as "student learning," "volunteer coordination," or "general FAQ."
   - Student Agent: Handles academic doubts, study planning, career guidance using tools and memory.
   - Volunteer Agent: Manages schedules, events, attendance, and reporting using database/sheet tools.
   - This multi-agent design mirrors real-world GHF workflows and demonstrates course concepts (sequential + parallel agents).

2. **Tools are core to impact**
   - Learning Tools: Study plan generator, knowledge base search, quiz generator.
   - Operations Tools: Google Sheets API for volunteer schedules, attendance tracker, event logs.
   - Communication Tool: WhatsApp integration to meet users where they already are.
   - Without tools, the system would be a generic chatbot. With tools, it becomes a **productivity multiplier**.

3. **Memory and Sessions**
   - Student memory: Tracks class, subjects, exam dates, learning progress, previous doubts to personalize support.
   - Volunteer memory: Tracks availability patterns, event preferences, and past contributions.
   - This enables **continuity** and **personalization**â€”solving the "start from scratch each time" problem.
   - Individual student memory bank: For each student, the system maintains a personal profile with course (engineering/medicine/arts), year, key exams (semester, GATE, NEET PG, placements), subjects, interaction history (doubts, quiz results), and preferences (language, interests). This enables the agent to adapt explanations, recommend focused practice on weak topics, and continue long-term learning journeys instead of one-off Q&A.

4. **Real-world impact is measurable**
   - For students: Reduces doubt-resolution time from days to minutes; provides 24/7 learning support.
   - For volunteers: Reduces coordination overhead by 40â€“60%; enables 2â€“3x more participants per event.
   - For GHF: Enables scaling to 1000+ students without proportional increases in coordinator workload.

## PART B: WRITEUP - PROBLEM, SOLUTION, ARCHITECTURE & JOURNEY (15 points)

### The Problem

**Context:**
Gold Heart Foundation is a registered NGO in Chennai that mentors underprivileged college students in engineering, medicine, and arts disciplines, providing academic support, career guidance, and mentorship through volunteer-led initiatives. GHF primarily uses WhatsApp groups for communicationâ€”a channel where mentors, students, and volunteers already congregate.

**The Pain:**

1. **For Students:**
   - Limited access to timely doubt clarification. A student posting a question in a WhatsApp group may wait hours or days for a mentor response.
   - No personalized learning guidance. Each student receives generic advice; progress is not tracked.
   - Information is scattered: tuition schedules, exam tips, resource links are buried in chat history.
   - Career guidance is reactive, not proactive. Students don't get targeted preparation for their specific exam (GATE, NEET PG, etc.).

2. **For Volunteers & Coordinators:**
   - Manual scheduling chaos. Volunteers text availability to the group; coordinators manually track who is available for which session.
   - Event reminders are manual. No automated follow-up, leading to no-shows and poor attendance.
   - No structured feedback. After events, there's no consistent way to log attendance, topics covered, or issues faced.
   - Scaling is hard. Adding 50 more volunteers means 50x more manual coordination.

3. **For GHF's Mission:**
   - **The bottleneck:** Despite strong volunteer commitment, GHF cannot scale impact proportionally. Supporting 100 more students would require 100+ additional volunteer hours per week.
   - **The opportunity:** AI agents can automate routine tasks (scheduling, FAQs, progress tracking) and amplify mentor capacity, freeing humans for high-touch mentoring.

### The Solution

**What we're building:**

A **WhatsApp-based AI multi-agent system** that serves two user groups simultaneously:

#### For College Students: Learning & Career Support Agent

**Capabilities:**
1. **Instant doubt resolution** â€“ Students ask academic questions (e.g., "What is deadlock in OS?", "How to interpret an ECG?", "Journal entry for accounts"). Agent provides:
   - Conceptual explanation at appropriate depth for their level.
   - Step-by-step examples or practice problems.
   - Personalized follow-up based on their exam/subject profile.

2. **Personalized study planning** â€“ Students can request a study plan:
   - Input: exam name, subjects, available hours/week, target date.
   - Output: weekly breakdown of topics, daily tasks, revision schedule.
   - Tracks progress and adjusts if needed.

3. **Career & exam guidance** â€“ Covers placements, internships, competitive exams (GATE, NEET PG, UPSC foundation, CAT).
   - Resume tips, interview Q&A, exam strategies, timeline advice.

4. **Curated resource access** â€“ Links to notes, videos, mock tests pre-vetted by GHF mentors (no random internet noise).

5. **Learning streaks & reminders** â€“ Gentle nudges to maintain daily study habits, personalized by student profile.
6. **Personalized memory-driven support – Every student has a personal “learning memory bank” that stores their background, doubts, and performance over time, so the agent can say things like “last week you struggled with OS deadlocks, here’s a quick recap + 3 new questions” and adjust difficulty as they improve.​

#### For Volunteers & Operations: Coordination & Reporting Agent

**Capabilities:**
1. **Availability collection & scheduling** â€“ Volunteers text commands like `/available Sat 4-7pm Siragugal-centre`. Agent logs to a Google Sheet + DB.

2. **Automated event reminders** â€“ 1 day before and 1 hour before events, agent sends reminders with venue, time, contact person.

3. **Quick confirmation flow** â€“ Volunteers confirm or cancel in one tap. System tracks attendance automatically.

4. **FAQs for volunteers** â€“ Answer common questions: "Where is the venue?", "What time does Kalvi Pattarai start?", "How do I request leave?", "Who is the centre lead?"

5. **Session reporting** â€“ After an event, bot asks: "How many students attended?", "Topics covered?", "Any issues?". Responses populate a structured log for GHF leadership.

6. **Impact summaries** â€“ Weekly/monthly reports: total students reached, volunteer hours, topics covered, attendance trends.

#### Key Concepts from the Intensive

**1. Multi-Agent System**
- Router agent classifies message type â†’ routes to appropriate sub-agent.
- Student and Volunteer agents operate sequentially (one completes, next acts) or in parallel (both may update shared logs).

**2. Tools**
- **Study Plan Generator**: Takes exam date, subjects, hours/week â†’ outputs structured weekly plan.
- **Knowledge Base Search**: Retrieves pre-vetted notes/FAQs using semantic search.
- **Quiz Generator**: Creates 5â€“10 practice questions on a topic.
- **Sheets API Tool**: CRUD operations on volunteer availability and session logs.
- **Event Lookup Tool**: Query calendar for upcoming sessions/centers.

**3. Memory & Sessions**
- **Student Memory Bank**: Stores class, subjects, exam dates, learning history, doubts asked (for context in future chats).
- **Volunteer Memory**: Availability patterns, preferences, event history.
- Enables continuity: "I remember you're preparing for GATEâ€”here's an updated study plan based on the weeks remaining."
- Individual student memory bank: For each student, the system maintains a personal profile with course (engineering/medicine/arts), year, key exams (semester, GATE, NEET PG, placements), subjects, interaction history (doubts, quiz results), and preferences (language, interests). This enables the agent to adapt explanations, recommend focused practice on weak topics, and continue long-term learning journeys instead of one-off Q&A.

**4. Context Engineering**
- Maintain a compact context window by summarizing old doubts/progress into bullet points.
- Only load relevant student profile info (e.g., "this student is 10th-grade maths + competitive exam prep").

**5. Logging & Observability**
- Log all agent decisions: which agent was triggered, which tools were called, student/volunteer action.
- Track metrics: average doubt resolution time, study plan completion rate, volunteer attendance ratio, event coordination efficiency.

### Why This Solves the Problem

1. **Scalability**: Instead of 1 mentor handling 5 students, 1 mentor + 1 agent can handle 20 students (15 automated, 5 high-touch).

2. **24/7 availability**: Students get instant doubt resolution at 11 PM when they're studying, not waiting for tomorrow's mentor.

3. **Personalization at scale**: Memory and context allow the system to adapt to each student's exam, pace, and learning history.

4. **Volunteer empowerment**: Coordinators no longer spend 10 hours/week on scheduling; they spend 2 hours reviewing reports and coaching mentors.

5. **Measurable impact**: GHF can now report:
   - "We supported 1,000 students this year (2x growth) with the same 50 volunteers."
   - "Average question resolution time: 5 minutes (was 2 days)."
   - "Volunteer event attendance: 95% (was 65%)."

### Innovation & Value for "Agents for Good"

- **Novel application**: Most education chatbots are Q&A only. This is a **dual-purpose multi-agent system** that simultaneously scales learning + operations.
- **Real-world relevance**: Designed with a real NGO (GHF), solving real pain points, using their actual communication channel (WhatsApp).
- **Sustainable model**: No proprietary tools requiredâ€”uses open-source libraries, free Google tools (Sheets, Gemini API), and can run on modest infrastructure.
- **Replicable**: The architecture (router â†’ specialized agents â†’ tools) can be adapted for other NGOs, charities, or social enterprises.
